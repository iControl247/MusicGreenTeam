# Music Green Team Project
The purpose of this repository is to act as a code base for the development of a LED Reactive Sound System for the 2021 Senior Design Capstone Course.

# Project Background
- Lighting decorators want an accessible and adjustable reactive RGB (red green blue) lighting system to allow lighting to augment music in a space.
- To achieve this, the goal of this project is to create a music reactive lighting system composed of three lighting fixtures working in combination with an electronic signal read from an audio source while creating lighting effects that match the time and intensity of the music inputted to the system​

# Project Scope
- Implement audio input to accept an audio signal from consumer devices​
- The input signal needs to be converted to a format where data can be read ​
- Control and lighting signals need to be generated from data from the input signal​
- Input signal needs to be played back in time with lighting control signals
